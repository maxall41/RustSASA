abstract={Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract = {The sizes of atomic groups are a fundamental aspect of protein structure. They are usually expressed in terms of standard sets of radii for atomic groups and of volumes for both these groups and whole residues. Atomic groups, which subsume a heavy-atom and its covalently attached hydrogen atoms into one moiety, are used because the positions of hydrogen atoms in protein structures are generally not known. We have calculated new values for the radii of atomic groups and for the volumes of atomic groups. These values should prove useful in the analysis of protein packing, protein recognition and ligand design. Our radii for atomic groups were derived from intermolecular distance calculations on a large number (∼30,000) of crystal structures of small organic compounds that contain the same atomic groups to those found in proteins. Our radii show significant differences to previously reported values. We also use this new radii set to determine the packing efficiency in different regions of the protein interior. This analysis shows that, if the surface water molecules are included in the calculations, the overall packing efficiency throughout the protein interior is high and fairly uniform. However, if the water structure is removed, the packing efficiency in peripheral regions of the protein interior is underestimated, by ∼3.5%.}
